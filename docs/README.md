| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
|**aws-cloudformation.md** | Details how to provision and deploy an EC2 instance via AWS's CloudFormation tool |
|**terraform.md** | Same as above, but instead of using AWSCloudFormation tool, it uses - as the name suggests - Terraform|

## Using this Documentation

1. Review with the main README.md file in the project's root for a high level overview of the project

2. Set up your private Discord Server & capturing the webhook in your AWS Secrets Manager by following [discord-setup.md](discord-setup.md)

3. Currently - choose the manual route to set up your VM. ~~Now you have a choice between these 3 options for setting up the VM~~:
    1. GUI (Manual)
        - [AWS Console Manager](aws-console-manager.md)
    2. ~~Terminal~~ (temporarly on hold due to scope creep)
        - [AWS CloudFormation]
        - [Terraform]

4. Follow [modifying-instance.md](modifying-instance.md) to enable the instance to have GUI access üñ•Ô∏è.

5. If successful, you should now have GUI access to your machine ü•≥üéâ

Now should follow the [mandatory manual instructions](mandatory-manual.md) to add the python file(s) and do the final leg of the setup. Just to reiterate, this part is 'necessary' to by-pass Instagram's restrictions on Selenium.

~~for the other methods, just include the programmatic version in those files.~~
