# Raspberry Pi Proxy

### Purpose:
Outdated - seems like smaller EC2 instances are untrustorthy according to Instagram. However, when I switched to a bigger EC2 instance due to the t2.micro being too slow to be able to do the job of monitoring the page.

So, what I'm trying to get at is that after all this work of setting up the Pi and making it work with my less powerful EC2 instance, I realized I didnt even have to include the Pi into my workflow due to the bigger EC2 instances being more trustworthy. 

However, I will create + publish this page due to not wanting my efforts to go to waste lol.
